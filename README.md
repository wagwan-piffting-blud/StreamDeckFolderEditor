# Stream Deck Folder Editor

_What_ is this?
---
A simple Python script to move the "back" button inside a folder on your Stream Deck. Based on the BarRaider utility of the same name. Please see https://github.com/BarRaider/streamdeck-foldereditor for that version, which is no longer working and no longer receiving updates.
